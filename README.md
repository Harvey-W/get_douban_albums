# get_doubancelebrity
A simple spider/Douban.com sources/Find intros and albums of common celebrities all of the world

> - Two gogerious ladies inspired me to make this tiny project.
> - I made two part of them: one is for personal Douban users' requests, initiated as the basic version. The other one is to seek general celebries, such as Aragaki Yui that I have just mentioned her. (1/2) :)
>- THIS IS MY FIRST PYTHON PROJECT WITH ORIGINAL THOUGHTS.
> -  There will be an important function to fulfill my <Data Analyst> style, also bugs to fix and revise codes to be pythonic.
